<h2>Tastes are different</h2>
<p>Children like different foods than adults. Older people have different energy requirements than young people who work physically or do a lot of sport. If you want to lose weight, you have to follow different rules than a person who is underweight. And not everyone wants to live vegetarian and in future will only shop in the health food store.

The state of nutritional science corresponds, for example, to the recommendations of the German Nutrition Society (DGE) in Bonn. They are based on well-founded scientific knowledge.

Some foods are considered more nutritionally recommended - for example fruits, vegetables, fish, low-fat dairy products, low-fat meat, rapeseed oil, drinking and mineral water. Lemonades or sweets, among other things, are less recommended, according to the DGE, they should only be consumed in moderation.

As in many other areas of life, it is also important to find the right balance in nutrition - suitable for the respective age, energy requirements and state of health. Because with a sensibly compiled diet, the desired weight can be achieved and kept long-term. In addition, diseases can be prevented and disease processes can be positively influenced under certain circumstances. What can a healthy diet look like? You will find many suggestions here on this page.
"> If you eat a reasonably varied diet and do not eat more than your body burns, you are doing everything right. These are findings that most consumers are obviously not aware of - the fear of not eating healthy enough is growing.</p>
<h3>Better healthy than tasty</h3>
<p>A survey by the technical health insurance company showed that 45 percent of Germans make sure that it is healthy when eating - in this survey, "tasty" only made second place.</p>
<p>Ingrid Mühlhäuser, professor at the University of Hamburg, examines medical studies for their intrinsic value. "The problem with all nutritional studies is methodology. A pharmaceutical study is blinded and placebo-controlled. But you know what you have eaten. Most of the time, the only question asked is what was eaten. The only really good study, with a large number of participants and over Eight years has shown that it did not matter how the subjects were fed: cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes - all the same.</p>
<p>Peter Nawroth von der Universität Heidelberg und Andreas Fritsche von der Universität Tübingen ärgern sich über den Stellenwert, den die Regeln der DGE in der Gesellschaft haben: unwissenschaftlich und durch nichts belegt, lautet ihr Fazit. Die Bedeutung von gesunder Ernährung für ein längeres, gesünderes Leben wird aus ihrer Sicht dadurch völlig überschätzt. So wird ein gigantisches Geschäft befeuert: Ernährungsberater, Lebensmittelindustrie, Verlage – alle verdienen an der Angst vor Fehlernährung, obwohl die Menschen selten zuvor besser und nährstoffreicher ernährt waren als heute.</p>
